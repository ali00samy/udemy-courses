# Udemy Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of Udemy course data, leveraging Python and Jupyter Notebook. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), custom functions, and visualizations to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. The project demonstrates skills in data wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and standardizing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Unveiling patterns in course categories, student engagement, and pricing strategies.
- **Custom Functions**: Modularized Python functions for reusability and efficiency.
- **Visualizations**: Clear and insightful graphs created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:
  - Bar charts for course popularity by category.
  - Histograms for pricing distribution.
  - Scatter plots to analyze relationships between variables.
  - Line plots for trends over time.
- **Insights**: Actionable recommendations for course creators based on the data.
